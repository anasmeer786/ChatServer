# Python Chat Application with Sockets and Threading

This project was done by me and another team member Suayeb Ahmed for COMP3825

This repository contains a simple chat application implemented in Python, leveraging sockets and threading to enable real-time communication. The project is divided into two main scripts:

## Client Script (`client.py`):

- Requests the user to input their name.
- Establishes a connection with the server using a specified IP address and port.
- Utilizes two threadsâ€”one for receiving messages and another for sending messages concurrently.
- Provides a clean exit mechanism with the ".exit" command.

## Server Script (`server.py`):

- Binds to a specified IP address and port, waiting for incoming connections.
- Accepts client connections, assigns a unique name, and maintains a list of connected clients.
- Employs threading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- Manages disconnections gracefully and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

## How to Run:

1. Execute the server script (`server.py`) on your machine.
2. Run the client script (`client.py`) on multiple machines or in separate terminal windows.
3. Input your name when prompted by the client script.
4. Start engaging in conversations with other connected clients.
